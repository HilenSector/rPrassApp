# rPrass Super App - 30-Day Development Plan

**Goal:** Develop a functional version of the rPrass Android app incorporating core features (Auth, Payments, Collaboration, Education, Analytics View) with a strong focus on security, laying the groundwork for future expansion and LLM integration.

**Timeline:** 30 Days (approx. 4 Weeks)
**Daily Budget:** 300 Credits

## Week 1: Foundation & Core Authentication (Days 1-7)

*   **Goal:** Establish project structure, implement secure user authentication, and build basic UI shell.
*   **Day 1 (Completed):** Project setup (Android Studio structure, Gradle), Git init, basic theme (Deep Blue), navigation structure, main activity, application class.
*   **Day 2:** Implement Login & Register UI screens using Jetpack Compose. Set up ViewModels for these screens.
*   **Day 3:** Configure Firebase Authentication backend. Implement user registration flow (UI -> ViewModel -> Repository -> Firebase Auth).
*   **Day 4:** Implement user login flow. Implement session management (e.g., token persistence, auto-login check).
*   **Day 5:** Implement password reset functionality. Refine authentication error handling (displaying user-friendly messages).
*   **Day 6:** Create a basic user profile screen (view/edit minimal info). Set up Firestore database for storing basic user profile data securely.
*   **Day 7:** Write unit tests for ViewModels and integration tests for the authentication flow. Code cleanup, documentation review. Commit Week 1 progress.
*   **Milestone:** Secure user authentication (Register, Login, Reset Password, Session Management) implemented and tested. Basic app structure and profile screen ready.

## Week 2: Secure Payment System Integration (Days 8-14)

*   **Goal:** Integrate a secure payment system (Stripe).
*   **Day 8:** Set up Stripe developer account. Configure Stripe Android SDK in the project. Set up Firebase Cloud Functions project for secure backend operations.
*   **Day 9:** Implement the backend Cloud Function to create Stripe PaymentIntents securely.
*   **Day 10:** Design and implement the UI for initiating a payment (e.g., selecting a service/product, entering amount).
*   **Day 11:** Integrate Stripe Payment Sheet or Payment Element into the Android app to handle payment method input.
*   **Day 12:** Implement the flow to call the Cloud Function, retrieve the PaymentIntent secret, and launch the Stripe UI. Handle payment success and failure callbacks from the SDK.
*   **Day 13:** Implement a basic screen to display the user's transaction history (fetching data from Stripe/Firestore).
*   **Day 14:** Conduct thorough testing of the payment flow using Stripe test cards. Review security aspects of the integration. Commit Week 2 progress.
*   **Milestone:** Basic secure payment functionality integrated and testable via Stripe.

## Week 3: Collaboration & Educational Content Modules (Days 15-21)

*   **Goal:** Implement foundational features for the collaboration platform and educational content portal.
*   **Day 15:** Design data models in Firestore for collaboration spaces (e.g., projects, channels, messages) and educational content (e.g., articles, categories).
*   **Day 16:** Implement UI screens for browsing educational content categories and viewing individual articles/content pieces.
*   **Day 17:** Implement fetching educational content from Firestore and displaying it in the UI.
*   **Day 18:** Design and implement the basic UI for the collaboration section (e.g., list of collaboration spaces/projects).
*   **Day 19:** Implement functionality to create new collaboration spaces/projects and view existing ones the user belongs to.
*   **Day 20:** Implement basic real-time message posting and viewing within a selected collaboration space using Firestore listeners.
*   **Day 21:** Conduct testing for content browsing and basic collaboration features. Commit Week 3 progress.
*   **Milestone:** Educational content portal (viewing) and basic collaboration space features (create, view, basic messaging) are functional.

## Week 4: Data Analytics View, LLM Prep & Refinement (Days 22-30)

*   **Goal:** Implement a basic data analytics view, prepare for LLM integration, refine existing features, and ensure overall app quality.
*   **Day 22:** Design the UI for a basic data analytics dashboard, tailored for the researcher persona (initially showing placeholder/sample data).
*   **Day 23:** Implement the analytics dashboard UI, fetching and displaying sample data visualizations (using a simple chart library if feasible, or just text/tables).
*   **Day 24:** Identify key areas for future Professor's LLM integration (e.g., within analytics, collaboration). Define placeholder functions/API interfaces/hooks in the codebase.
*   **Day 25:** Conduct a focused security review across the application (dependency checks, data storage encryption, network security for Cloud Functions).
*   **Day 26:** Perform UI/UX refinement across all implemented modules. Ensure consistent application of the deep blue theme and smooth navigation.
*   **Day 27:** Conduct comprehensive integration testing: Auth -> Profile -> Payments -> Collaboration -> Content -> Analytics View.
*   **Day 28:** Dedicated bug fixing day based on testing results. Address any performance bottlenecks identified.
*   **Day 29:** Update documentation (README, code comments). Prepare build configurations (e.g., signing keys, build variants if needed).
*   **Day 30:** Final end-to-end testing. Code freeze for the 30-day development phase. Prepare a demo build. Commit final Week 4 progress.
*   **Milestone:** Core features integrated, refined, and tested. App includes basic analytics view and LLM integration points. Ready for internal review or a potential closed testing phase.

**Note:** This plan is ambitious and assumes smooth progress. We will conduct daily testing (Step 006) and may need to adjust priorities within weeks based on complexity encountered. Regular progress reporting (Step 009) will keep you informed.
